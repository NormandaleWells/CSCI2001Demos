The ones we'll use:

assertEqual(a, b)	a == b
assertNotEqual(a, b)	a != b
assertTrue(x)	bool(x) is True
assertFalse(x)	bool(x) is False
assertIsNone(x)	x is None
assertIsNotNone(x)	x is not None

Other useful ones:

assertIs(a, b)	a is b
assertIsNot(a, b)	a is not b
assertIn(a, b)	a in b
assertNotIn(a, b)	a not in b
assertIsInstance(a, b)	isinstance(a, b)
assertNotIsInstance(a, b)	not isinstance(a, b)
assertGreater(a, b) a > b
assertGreaterEqual(a, b) a >= b
assertLesser(a, b) a < b
assertLessEqual(a, b) a <= b
assertAlmostEqual(a, b) a almost = b
assertNotAlmostEqual(a, b) a not almost = b

The last two are useful for checking floating point
calculations.  By default they check for equality to
within 7 decimal places, but this can be overridden.

setUp() is an optional method called before every test

Method names must start with "test"


If we covered exceptions, we could also add exceptions
to test preconditions and verify that they get thrown
by using

assertRaises(ex, x) does x raise exception ex
